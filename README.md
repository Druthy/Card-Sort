# Card-Sort
Project to learn arduino with the end goal of making a card sorter

I will use a TCS 3200 colour sensor to detect the colour or element of a card and shuffle cards by element for my first project. Later, I plan to investigate and test solutions for scanning and sorting by specifc card names.

My planned steps are as follows
  * play around with relevant functionality
  * read colour from sensor
  * save colour data in txt format
  * calibrate colour sensor for specific elements
  * correctly detect elements
  * design sorting algorithm
  * build sorting mechanism
  * piece together, run, review, and improve
